# CH32 RISC-V User Group

This is a user group that uses RISC-V chips such as WCH's CH32V series.

# Repositories

## EVT

- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32V003
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32V006
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32V103
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32V20x
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32V307
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32X035
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/CH32L103

This is a repository that compiles information such as data sheets created for each EVT file.

## Toolchain Miror

- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/MounRiver_Studio_Community_miror

This is a mirror site of MounRiver Studio Community. There are also files compressed in toolchain units.

## Arduino IDE

- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/arduino_core_ch32_riscv_noneos
- https://github.com/ch32-riscv-ug/arduino_core_ch32_riscv_arduino

There is arduino_core_ch32_riscv_noneos, which allows EVT code to run on Arduino IDE, and arduino_core_ch32_riscv_arduino, which is compatible with Arduino.
